# Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
Within Project Two, I had created the code within the mainloop of the application to make the neural networks in the pirate game. This helped with the exploration / exploitation process in the assignment as well. 

# What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists research, design, and develop both software and hardware. According to Michigan Technological University (2024), "Computer scientists design, develop, and analyze the software and hardware used to solve problems in all kinds of business, industry, scientific, and social contexts. And because computers solve problems to serve and enrich people, there is a significant human component to computer science" (para. 3). This matters because it is important because software/hardware is used within multiple industries and requires computer scientsists to be able to make efficient tools to help business, finance, science, etc continue to thrive by using modern technology -- developed by the computer scientist. 

# How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
As a computer scientist, a problem would be approached with a meticulous step-by-step process. There would likely be the classic scientific method being used and allowing for a hypothesis, identification of a specific need, etc, and go from there in solving it. Each problem would be approached differently for the various needs. 

# What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
The ethical responsibilities for the end user and the organization will be in data privacy and information security. By protecting both the user and the organization data and private information, it can help allow for the businesses to progress ethically without risk of endangering a user or the organization itself. Software security is a prime aspect to focus on and ensuring that ethical practices are being maintained.
